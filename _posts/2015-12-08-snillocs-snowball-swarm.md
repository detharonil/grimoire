_2nd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 90 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of ice or a small white rock chip)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

A flurry of magic snowballs erupts from a point you choose within range. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
