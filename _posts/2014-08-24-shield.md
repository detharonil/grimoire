_1st-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack or targeted by the _[magic missile](../magic-missile/)_ spell  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 round

An invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from _[magic missile](../magic-missile/)_.
